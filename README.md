# MicSetup
An installation builder program made in PascalABC.NET, everything was written from scratch by me, Michael Agarkov.

MicSetup right now has just the basic stuff an installation builder has, and I am planning to add more in the future.

It's distributed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0, so you can make **your own versions of it**, if you follow the EULA, of course.

It's size is also **lesser than a megabyte**, which makes it be very compact and perfect for your small laptop ;)

I didn't really make it be able to build single executable installers yet, right now it only builds installers which have everything located in a folder, perfect for a CD disc, right?

I hope you like it, and you will make use out of it!

For the source code, I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET
