## Download MicSetup

- [Releases](https://github.com/MichaelAgarkov/MicSetup/releases)
- [Source code](https://github.com/MichaelAgarkov/MicSetup)

### Compiler for the source code
I recommend using [PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050](https://archive.org/download/pascalabc.net/PascalABCNETWithDotNetSetup.exe) because it's the version MicSetup is compiled in.

For the installer, I recommend using [Inno Setup 6.0.5](https://archive.org/download/InnoSetup6.0.5/innosetup-6.0.5.exe), because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in.
